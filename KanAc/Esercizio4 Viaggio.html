    <p>Berlin, capital and chief urban centre of Germany. The city lies at the heart of the North German Plain, athwart
        an east-west commercial and geographic axis that helped make it the capital of the kingdom of Prussia and then,
        from 1871, of a unified Germany. Berlin’s former glory ended in 1945, but the city survived the destruction of
        World War II. It was rebuilt and came to show amazing economic and cultural growth.</p>

    <p>I t is located in the western part of the city centre of Berlin within Mitte, at the junction of Unter den Linden
        and Ebertstraße, immediately west of the Pariser Platz. One block to the north stands the Reichstag building,
        which houses the German parliament (Bundestag). The gate is the monumental entry to Unter den Linden, a
        boulevard of linden trees which led directly to the royal City Palace of the Prussian monarchs.Throughout its
        existence, the Brandenburg Gate was often a site for major historical events and is today considered not only as
        a symbol of the tumultuous history of Europe and Germany, but also of European unity and peace.</p>

    <p> The Berlin Wall was a guarded
        concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989.[1] Construction of the wall
        was commenced by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) on 13 August 1961. The Wall cut off West
        Berlin from surrounding East Germany, including East Berlin.[2] The barrier included guard towers placed along
        large concrete walls,[3] accompanied by a wide area (later known as the "death strip") that contained
        anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its
        population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the "will of the people" from building a socialist state
        in East Germany.</p>
